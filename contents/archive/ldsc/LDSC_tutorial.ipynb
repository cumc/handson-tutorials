    "# LD Score Regression Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Anmol Singh (singh.anmol@columbia.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Please find [here a brief review of LDSC](https://cumc.github.io/xqtl-pipeline/pipeline/integrative_analysis/enrichment/ldsc.html). This page also implements a pipeline version of LDSC analysis for real-world data analysis. In this tutorial we focus on analysis of an example data-set to illustrate how LDSC works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing LDSC with Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have installed python 2 and conda (if you want to install ldsc using conda). Conda can be installed using this link: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Clone the Github Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/bulik/ldsc.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd ldsc`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Activate the Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env create --file environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "`source activate ldsc`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check to see if the main python scripts used for analysis are executable\n",
    "\n",
    "`./ldsc.py -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "`./munge_sumstats.py -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "Check to make sure that both `./ldsc.py -h` and `./munge_sumstats.py -h` output the list of all possible commands for both, otherwise there is something wrong with the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing LDSC without Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Clone the Github Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone https://github.com/bulik/ldsc.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd ldsc`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Make the python scripts executeable\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod +x ldsc.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod +x munge_sumstats.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check to see if the main python scripts used for analysis are executable\n",
    "\n",
    "`./ldsc.py -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "`./munge_sumstats.py -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pybedtools is required for make_annot.py, if you need to make binary annotations and did not install through conda you must either install pybedtools on the cluster or use it through this docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Load Docker Image that has pybedtools\n",
    "\n",
    "`module load Singularity`\n",
    "\n",
    "`module load R`\n",
    "\n",
    "`singularity pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/pybedtools-0.8.0-py27he860b03_1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this image you will now be able to use the `make_annot.py` script with no issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Analysis 1: Simple LD Score Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple example of non-partitioned LD Score Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the plink files needed for this tutorial here: https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/1000G_Phase3_plinkfiles.tgz. This file contains the bim/bam/fam files for 489 subjects for all 1000 Genome Phase 3 SNPs which will be used as the reference panel for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after downloading the data we can take a look at a simple example calculating the LD scores for 1000 Genome Phase 3 variants on chromosome 22. To conduct the regression we must do this for every chromosome but the commands are the same so I will just show it for one. A great way that I have found to loop over all the chromosomes in parallel is to use xargs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "seq 1 22| xargs -n 1 -I j -P 4 python ldsc.py --bfile 1000G.EUR.QC.j --l2 --ld-wind-cm 1 --out tutorial.j \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This xargs command will loop over the command passed to it using the iterative variable j (marked with the -I flag). The -n 1 flag indicates that there is one iterative variable and the -P 4 flag indicates that 4 of the iterative commands will be submitted at a time (e.g. chr1,chr2,chr3,chr4 will be submitted in a batch and then after that is done the next 4 will start).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the command flags: --bfile indicates that the file is a plink bed/bim/fam file with that prefix, --l2 indicates you want to calculate LD Scores, --ld-wind-cm indicates that you want to calculate LD Scores using a 1 cM window, and --out indicates the prefix you want to use for output files"

    "After calculating LD Scores for each chromosome, it is time to set up the summary statistic file for the phenotype you are trying to analyze. The summary statistic file we will use is for BMI and it can be downloaded here: http://www.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files. For the tutorial you also need the list of hapmap snps to restrict the summary statistic file to the recommended HapMap Phase 3 SNPs that will be used in the regression. The authors recommend restricting the analysis to HapMap Phase 3 SNPs because most GWAS summary statistics do not have information about imputation quality, thus using HapMap SNPs insures that you are using well-imputed and common variants for the analysis. This file can be downloaded here: https://storage.googleapis.com/broad-alkesgroup-public/LDSCORE/w_hm3.snplist.bz2. The summary statistic file should have the following columns with the following names for the analysis to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "SNP -- SNP identifier (e.g., rs number)\n",
    "\n",
    "N -- sample size (which may vary from SNP to SNP).\n",
    "\n",
    "P -- p-value.\n",

    "A2-- second allele (other allele)\n",
    "\n",
    "Signed Summary Statistic (Can be Z, BETA, or Odds Ratio(label as OR)), is optional if A1 is the risk increasing allele as you can put the flag --a1-inc in the command and ldsc will calculate the Z score for the SNPs for you\n",
